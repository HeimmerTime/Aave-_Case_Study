## AAVE Case Study
## Overview and Origin
## Aave Protocol

When was the company incorporated? 
>>Aave was founded by Stani Kulechov in November 2017. It originally known as ETHLend and was rebranded as Aave in September 2018. ETHlend was the first lending application on Ethereum pre-dating decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins (defirate.com). ETHLend was rebranded to Aave, meaning "ghost" in Finnish. According to founder Stani in an interview with DefiRate.com said, "With ETHLend, we were bound to 'ETH' and 'Lending'. With Aave, we can do much more than that." Aave is working to become more than just lending. The shift to Aave also moved ETHlend from a P2P lending strategy to a pool-based strategy. (Aave.com)

Who are the founders of the company? 
>>Stani Kulechov 

How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
>>After the banking bailouts in 2008 Kulechov was amazed at the lack of transparency that goes on despite regulations in place. Even ten years later the bailouts were continuing. People had limited options when it came to borrowing and lending - having to bank with intitutions they had limited trust in. He saw an opportunity by utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technology to create a P2P lending protocol. Creating a lending protocol on the blockchain results in less fees, transparency, and the whole process happens instantly. (chippin.com)

How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
>>The company initially raised $16.2 million through an ICO round. (coingecko). In total "Aave has raised a total of $24M in funding over 5 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jan 30, 2021 from a Secondary Market round." (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ethlend/company_financials)



## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
>>Aave is a decentralised protocol that makes access to liquidity faster and easier. As stated on Aave.com, "Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing a collateral." This process eliminates the middle man, aka instituional banks whose process is slow and paperwork intensive. Aave's fees are also less than those of institional banks.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
>> Aave's intended customer is the retail customer. The protcol provides access to liquidity through pooled lending and use of collateral on the blockchain to eliminate the cumbersome and restrictive process of institutional bank lending. The market size of this customer is global reaching and for anyone looking to earn higher interest or borrow with ease. 

>>The Aave protocol has two types of competitors. The first being institutional banks and the second is other lending protocols in the DeFi space. As previously mentioned, traditional banking can take months to process, lots of paperwork, and can have excessive fees. Utilizing blockchain technology, Aave can quickly and instantly lend money based on pooled reserves to borrowers with collateral. 

>> There are several other lending protocols that use blockchain technology to lend. Some protocols have adopted a P2P based lending protocol based on smart contracts between the lender and the borrower. Aave has moved to a pool based lending protocol which allows for pooled money to be lent to borrowers with collateral and loans do not need to be individually matched. "this enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool." (Aave.com) 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
>>Aave protocol uses blockchain technology and oracle's pull data to the blockchain.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 
>>Aave is in the lending domain within the greater decentralized finance space.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
>> Aave was the first lending protocol on the Ethereum network. Since its inception, technology in the space has advanced incorporating smart contracts and blockchain technology establishing governance and further advancement in DeFi front-end integrations. Aave also migrated from a P2P lending protocol to a pool based protocol allowing for increased available funds/reserves to be lent out and increased access to liquidity by eliminating individually matached loans.

* What are the other major companies in this domain? 
>>Several other protocols have entered the lending domain in the past couple of years. Protocols including Yearn Finance and Compound being its largest competitors on the Blockchain.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
>> Aave currently has over $6.7B of "capital deposited into the platform in the form of loan collateral or liquidity trading pool." (Defi Llama). This and other metrics listed below show just how much Aave has impacted the DeFi space and contributed to the growth of the community at large. Aave continues to develop additional liquidity products to expand as a protocol and as a community within the blockchain.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
>> Lending protocols use metrics such as fully diluted valuation (FDV), total value locked (TVL), FDV/TVL ratio, circulating suppy, market cap/TVL ratio, and circulating supply.

>>Aave's current TVL is over $6.7B and growing at a rapid pace. It currently has $12.5M of it's $16M Max Supply in ciculation. Aave token allows for staking which builds its reserves that can be pushed back to token holders if proposed at a future date.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

>>Yearn Finance and Compound are two of Aave's largest competitors in the DeFi space. Yearn being the smaller of the two has only $36k circulating and a TVL of $3.1M. Compound has a lower circulating supply with $5M of the total $10M max supply. Overall Aave is dominating the space and continues to release additional liquidity/lending products such as flash loans in order to meet demand and grow. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
>> I think Aave would benefit extending loans to traditional businesses.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
>>Aave is one of the largest pool lenders in the DeFi relm. Expanding its offerings to businesses can grow the protocol exponentially and would help to expand and grow the community by providing additional liquidity.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
>> The Aave protocol can leverage its exisiting technology to provide businesses access to instant liquidity.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
>> The DeFi and blockchain technology is growing at a rapid pace. With that, many businesses and new protocols are looking to enter the space and capitalize on the exponential growth potential. Flash loans, collateralized loans, etc. are all appealing to businesses and protocols looking to enter the space.
